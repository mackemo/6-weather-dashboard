## Process

The process included creating a search input for any city. When a city was searched, the input value was put into an API url that was fetched for weather information. The API supplied by the bootcamp challenge needed an additional API called a geocode so that city inputs would translate into coordinates that inputted into the given url. Specific items in the arrays from the API data were selected to displayed the temperature, humidity, wind, and date in the web application. Additionally, a for loop was created for the five-day forecast to loop over several days. A conditional was put in place for the weather description to display a certain icon representing the weather. Four cities were saved in four buttons and when clicked on, presents the weather information for that city.
